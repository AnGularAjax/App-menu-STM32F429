# App-menu-STM32F429
In this project, I made an app Menu with the help of a STM32F429 controller with the commands below:
1.Read Appl version from the menuOption
2. Led ON (with UART communication, when I enter "1" in the console, the LED from the controller lights up)
3. Led OFF. 
4. Binary Conversion.
5. Dynamic Memory Allocation.
